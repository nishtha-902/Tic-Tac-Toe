# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game repository! This project is a classic implementation of the beloved Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's a great way to pass the time and challenge your friends or AI.
